 Candidate Evaluation Criteria
Before you start, please check out the items below, they are the evaluation criteria that we will be using to evaluate your test.
● Clean Code
● SOC (Separation of Concerns)
● Code optimized as much as possible
● Simplicity
● Programming Logic
● Flexibility/Extensibility
No question will be answered so you are free to solve the problem the way you think is best.
Statement of Work
You must build a data analysis system 100% coded in Java. The system must be able to import lots of flat files, read and analyse the data, and output a report.
Please read the following for more information about the input files, data analysis and the needed output.
Flat file layout
There are 3 kinds of data inside those files. For each kind of data there is a different layout.
Salesman data
Salesman data has the format id 001 and the line will have the following format.
001çCPFçNameçSalary
Customer data
Customer data has the format id 002 and the line will have the following format.
002çCNPJçNameçBusinessArea
Sales data
Sales data has the format id 003. Inside the sales row, there is the list of items, which is wrapped by square brackets []. The line will have the following format.
003çSaleIDç[ItemID-ItemQuantity-ItemPrice]çSalesmanname
      
 Sample file data
The following is a sample of the data that the application should be able to read. Note that this is a sample, real data could be 100% different.

Data analysis
Your system must read data from the default directory, located at %HOMEPATH%/data/in. The system must only read .datfiles.
After processing all files inside the input default directory, the system must create a flat file inside the default output directory, located at %HOMEPATH%/data/out. The filename must follow this pattern, {flat_file_name}.done.dat.
The output file contents should summarize the following data:
● Amount of clients in the input file
● Amount of salesman in the input file
● ID of the most expensive sale
● Worst salesman ever
This application should be running all the time, without any breaks. Everytime new files become available, everything should be executed.
Application Construction
As long as you code in Java you are free to build whatever kind application you feel that's suitable for the job.
You have total freedom to google everything you need, and ask also questions if you want to. Feel free to pick any external library if you need so.
 The score will not be affected if you do not use any external libraries. Just keep in mind the criterias above. Good luck :)
